# PassionatePrototypes
A collection of my notes and resources for working with Raspberry Pi, Adafruit, Arduino, Spark, and MicroBit.

<tt>thanks for stopping by!! this repository is a dumping ground for my prototyping passions. I build what I would consider niche, unique, valuable tools and iot devices/concepts. most of the tools that I build revolve around sigint, osint, war driving, drones, automoation and more. moving and consolidating all of my work here wont be an easy task now that 3 years have passed. upon my earthly departure I would at least like for all of my code, projects and ideas to live on through open source projects.</tt>

<tt>I will more than likely break the repo down by material I have relevant to each manufacturer or product line. my current interests have mostly revolved around radio ideas and meshtastic.</tt>
